After 7 years of running Triumphant HQ — from internet café days to SEO consulting — I made a decision that surprised even me: I started learning to code. Again.

## The Background

I'm not a stranger to tech. I've been setting up HP printers, managing WordPress sites, and optimizing websites for SEO since 2017. But coding? That was always someone else's domain.

Then AI happened.

## Why Now?

With tools like Claude, ChatGPT, and GitHub Copilot, the barrier to entry for coding has dropped dramatically. What used to take months of studying syntax and documentation can now be explored through conversation.

I'm not replacing developers — I'm augmenting my existing skills. Understanding how APIs work helps me serve my SEO clients better. Knowing React basics helps me communicate with developers on web projects.

## What I'm Learning

- **Next.js & React** — Building modern web applications (like this very site!)
- **TypeScript** — Because type safety matters
- **AI-Assisted Development** — Using AI tools to write, debug, and optimize code
- **"Vibe Coding"** — My term for the intuitive, AI-assisted approach to building things

## The Takeaway

You don't need to become a full-stack developer. But understanding code — even at a basic level — makes you better at whatever tech role you're in. And with AI as your copilot, there's never been a better time to start.

Stay tuned for more entries in this Tech Diary. I'll be documenting the journey, the mistakes, and the wins.
