After years of managing SEO for Nigerian businesses — from local shops in Ibadan to e-commerce stores targeting nationwide audiences — I've noticed the same mistakes popping up again and again.

## 1. Ignoring Google Business Profile

Your Google Business Profile is often the FIRST thing potential customers see. Yet most Nigerian businesses either don't have one or haven't updated it since creation.

**Quick Fix:** Claim your profile, add photos, update your hours, and respond to every review.

## 2. No Mobile Optimization

Over 80% of Nigerian internet users browse on mobile. If your site isn't mobile-friendly, you're losing most of your potential customers.

**Quick Fix:** Test your site on Google's Mobile-Friendly Test tool. If it fails, consider a responsive redesign.

## 3. Keyword Stuffing Instead of Value

Writing "best SEO agency in Lagos, SEO agency Lagos, Lagos SEO agency" five times in a paragraph doesn't work anymore. Google is smarter than that.

**Quick Fix:** Write for humans first. Use keywords naturally and focus on answering the questions your customers actually ask.

## 4. Neglecting Page Speed

A site that takes 10 seconds to load on a Nigerian 4G connection will lose visitors before they even see your content.

**Quick Fix:** Compress images, use a CDN, and minimize unnecessary plugins (especially on WordPress).

## 5. No Content Strategy

Posting once every 6 months isn't a content strategy. Consistency matters more than perfection.

**Quick Fix:** Start with one blog post per month. Cover topics your customers actually search for. Build from there.
